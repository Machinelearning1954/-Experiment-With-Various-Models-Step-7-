# ML Engineering Bootcamp Capstone Project - Step 7 Todo

## Phase 1: Project setup and data preparation
- [x] Determine problem domain and dataset (CIFAR-10 image classification)
- [x] Set up project structure and GitHub repository
- [x] Load and explore the dataset (CIFAR-10 data loader implemented)
- [x] Perform initial data preprocessing (transforms and normalization)
- [x] Define problem type (multi-class image classification)

## Phase 2: Performance metrics selection and cross-validation framework
- [x] Select appropriate performance metrics for the problem (accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC)
- [x] Design cross-validation strategy (Stratified K-Fold with 5 splits)
- [x] Implement evaluation framework (comprehensive metrics calculator)
- [x] Test evaluation pipeline (cross-validation evaluator implemented)

## Phase 3: Automated model testing framework development
- [ ] Create automated model training pipeline
- [ ] Implement hyperparameter tuning framework
- [ ] Set up experiment tracking and logging
- [ ] Create reproducible training process

## Phase 4: Model variety implementation and experimentation
- [ ] Implement traditional ML models (if applicable)
- [ ] Implement deep learning models with different architectures
- [ ] Run comprehensive experiments
- [ ] Analyze overfitting/underfitting patterns

## Phase 5: Results analysis and visualization
- [ ] Generate training/testing curves
- [ ] Create confusion matrices and other relevant plots
- [ ] Analyze model performance, training time, and size
- [ ] Compare all models systematically

## Phase 6: Documentation and presentation preparation
- [ ] Document all experiments in GitHub repository
- [ ] Create comprehensive presentation with graphs
- [ ] Prepare final model evaluation report
- [ ] Include cost and deployment considerations

## Phase 7: Final deliverables and project completion
- [ ] Review all requirements against rubric
- [ ] Finalize GitHub repository
- [ ] Complete presentation materials
- [ ] Submit final deliverables
